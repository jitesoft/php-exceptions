# Exceptions

Exception classes commonly used in Jitesoft php projects.  

All the exception classes implements a toArray method and implements the JsonSerializable interface.  
The structure of the classes is supposed to be as logic as possible. If anything seems off, please post a issue or make a pull-request.
No Exceptions will be moved or renamed without a new major version release.  

## Changes

#### 2.0.0

* All namespaces have had the `Exception` part of their name removed.
