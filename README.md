# Exceptions

A collection of exceptions commonly used - or derived from - in jitesoft php projects.

This project was created to easily share exceptions through all jitesoft projects made in php.  
All the exceptions derive from the JitesoftException class, and in case one is lazy, that one is possible to catch instead of the specific exceptions!
